# SlicerBatchBrainMRTumorSegmentation
This python scripted 3D Slicer module integrates the BraTS-Toolkit for automatically segmenting the brain tumour for user provided number of patients (as many as user required) in a folder. Furthermore, it computes the inverse transform to transform the Brat space segmentation result back to original T1-MRI space.
